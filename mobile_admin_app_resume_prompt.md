# Resume Prompt for `mobile_admin_app` Refactor (Option B Modularization)

We previously refactored my existing `mobile_admin_app` Flutter project into an **Option B modular architecture**.  
Here’s what has been completed so far:  

---

## **State of the Project**
- Repo structure now uses a monorepo layout:  
  ```
  apps/
    mobile_admin_app/
      lib/
        main.dart
        app.dart
        startup/
          splash/
            splash_screen.dart
          login/
            login_container.dart
            ui/
              login_screen.dart
        integration/
          composition/
            composition_firebase.dart
  packages/
    core_contracts/
      lib/
        core_contracts.dart
    firebase_auth_impl/
      lib/
        firebase_auth_impl.dart
  ```
- **`core_contracts`** contains vendor-neutral `AuthRepository` interface & models.  
- **`firebase_auth_impl`** implements that interface using Firebase Auth & Google Sign-In.  
- **`composition_firebase.dart`** wires the Firebase implementation to the interface.  
- `main.dart` now uses `makeAuthRepository()` from `composition_firebase.dart` so it has no direct Firebase imports.  
- `LoginContainer` gates the app flow:  
  - Shows Splash → Login → Admin (child widget)  
  - On `signOut()`, returns to login screen.  
- Emulator is working and app runs end-to-end with functional login and sign-out.  
- UI styling of login is minimal for now — we will address styling later.  

---

## **Functional Status**
✅ App boots on emulator  
✅ Auth flow works (Firebase)  
✅ Sign-out returns to login  
⚠ Login UI is placeholder (functional only)  
⚠ Admin features still live in app, not extracted to package yet  

---

## **Remaining Planned Steps**
1. **Extract login flow to its own package** (`packages/login_flow`) so it’s reusable in other apps.  
2. (Optional) Add `AuthScope` helper to allow any widget to call `signOut()` via the interface.  
3. (Optional) Extract admin features to their own package (`packages/admin_suite`).  
4. Add alternate composition files for other auth providers or mock auth for offline dev/testing.  
5. Document final repo structure & add scripts for dev workflow.  

---

## **Next Immediate Step**
Create the `login_flow` package and move:
- `apps/mobile_admin_app/lib/startup/login/login_container.dart`
- `apps/mobile_admin_app/lib/startup/login/ui/login_screen.dart`

Update `pubspec.yaml` in the app to depend on `login_flow` via a relative path, and update imports.

---

When we resume, please **start from Step 4** (extract login flow into `packages/login_flow`), walk me through creating the package, moving files, and adjusting imports so the app builds and runs on emulator again.
