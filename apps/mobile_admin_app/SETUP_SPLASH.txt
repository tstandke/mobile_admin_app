To use the default Flutter logo on the native splash (Android/iOS):

1) Replace assets/icon/flutter_logo.png with the official Flutter logo PNG (transparent background).
   - Recommended size: ~512x512 (square), transparent PNG.

2) From the app directory, run:
     dart run flutter_native_splash:create

3) Rebuild the app:
     flutter clean
     flutter pub get
     flutter run

Notes:
- This configuration sets the same logo for Android 12+ and pre-12, and for iOS.
- Background colors: light #FFFFFF, dark #121212.
- If you want a colored background, change 'color' values in pubspec.yaml under 'flutter_native_splash'.
