ðŸ“Œ CONTEXT REMINDER FOR CHATGPT

Project: Flutter mobile_admin_app
Location: C:\gcp-management\mobile_admin_app\apps\mobile_admin_app

Current Issue:
- The custom bird logo no longer appears during the native splash screen.
- Instead, the default Flutter logo (blurry) is shown while the app loads (~1â€“2 seconds).
- This worked before, but after recent patches, the logo setup regressed.

What We Have Done:
1. Applied a patch that added an exit button â€” patch succeeded.
2. Confirmed that flutter_native_splash is still configured.
3. Compared original vs. current files â€” some differences spotted.
4. Ensured `BuildRunApp.ps1` script can clean, fetch deps, and run app.
5. Verified package ID and adb path fixes.

Next Steps (to solve logo issue):
- Re-check `pubspec.yaml` flutter_native_splash section (should point to bird logo asset).
- Confirm the bird logo file exists in `assets/` and path matches exactly.
- Regenerate splash with:
    flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create --path=pubspec.yaml
- Verify that generated files in `android/app/src/main/res/drawable*` reference bird logo, not Flutter default.
- If mismatch remains, copy known-good asset from the original source ZIP into assets and regenerate.
- Test with `.\BuildRunApp.ps1 -Clean` again.

Goal:
- Restore bird logo as the only splash screen image (both native splash and Flutter intermediate splash).
